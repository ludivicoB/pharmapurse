# PharmaPurse
### PharmaPurse, a web app for small pharmaceutical businesses to streamline product purchasing.

This was a project for App Dev and Industry Elective 1, which was about creating web applications using ReactJS for the frontend and Java Springboot for the backend. Unfortunately we were not able to deploy this project but feel free to view our project demo! Hope you like it.
